- My motivation was really understand the dynamics of using dayjs and jquery in this project.
- This project was built to implement some aspects of jquery and focused around dayjs
- The problem was solved was to help people save info onto their local storage and utilize and page designed for people with busy schedules to organize their day.
- That you are able to implement jquery in javascript to dynamically tackle create multiple divs as opposed to creating a bunch of divs and utilizing dayjs to find the appropriate format of the day and time.
